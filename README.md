Previously, constructing windrose diagrams was not possible in locations where in-situ measurements of wind characteristics were not available. This limitation can be overcome by 
using NASA POWER data, with which wind speed and wind direction data can be directly downloaded to R using the package 'nasapower'. Then the windrose diagram is created by supplying the wind data 
to the 'windRose' function of 'openair' package.
